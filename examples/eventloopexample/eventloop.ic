/* This example demonstrates how you can run an interesting-c program as an event loop */

int main(){
    
}

__main__ = eventloop main;

/* __main__ defaults to int main() when there is one, but eventloop allows you to declare an event loop and the function which sets it up.

It takes an expression, so you can use a function from another module and give it parameters, useful for building external libraries. */
